# Drivers

 - For **linux web servers** you can follow [microsoft official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/connect/php/installation-tutorial-linux-mac?view=sql-server-2017)
 
 For **windows** download the drivers here: https://github.com/microsoft/msphpsql/releases/latest then place the .dll in the extension folder of your php (ext).
- **Becarefull about the _x64_ and _x86_ part**, if you need **Thread-Safe** or **Not-Thread-Safe** not and **make sure they are enabled in the php.ini** (the plugin will tell you which version if you took the wrong one

You can then follow the wiki : https://github.com/AzuriomCommunity/Game-Flyff/wiki
